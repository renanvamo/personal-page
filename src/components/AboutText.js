      <p>Hi! My name is Renan Moraes! I'm 36 years old, living and resisting in a complicated Brazil!</p>
      <br />

      <p>I'm a father of a brilliant child source of my greatest happiness, and by my side, I have a woman who supports me so I can realize my dream!
      And what is my dream? To find a reason to be proud in a job, and why not, love what I do! I had a career in a place where I couldn't see a future, so I knew I had to change my path and realize myself.</p>
      <br />
      
      <p>I'm a full-stack developer at the beginning of my career, but I have the ambition to achieve great things and help build a future with more love, inclusion, and code!</p>
      <br />

      <p>I started to learn coding at the Trybe in 2020, and I'll always be grateful to them for teaching me not only to code but also important values to my professional and personal life.</p>
      <br />
      
      <p>I reside today in SÃ£o Paulo with my family, Heitor, and Fabiana.</p>
